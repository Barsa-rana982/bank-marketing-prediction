# Bank Marketing Prediction 

This project uses the UCI Bank Marketing Dataset to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to classify whether a customer will say "yes" or "no" to a marketing offer based on demographic and campaign-related features.

##  Dataset
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)
- File: `bank-full.csv`
- Target column: `y` (yes/no)

## Methods Used
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Encoding
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix)

## Key Findings
- Duration of last call and previous outcomes are strong predictors.
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest performed best with balanced metrics.
- Imbalance in class labels was addressed using evaluation metrics beyond accuracy.

## Tools
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Open the notebook and run it step-by-step
